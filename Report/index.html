This benefits homeowners with more security and added convenience</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Firstly I started to investigate smart lighting, it has many benefits such as convenience , saving energy, scheduling and more. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Turning the lights off is necessary to save electricity and lower the bills, very often we forget to turn off the lights , it is also a simple way to lower your carbon footprint and save the environment</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">According to BBC news, light pollution affects up to 80% of the population.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">You can save a lot of energy by having the lights turn off automatically at a set time, this is also convenient for the home owner as they don&rsquo;t have to worry about leaving the lights on past a specific time. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Automatic lights are set to come on and shut off again at specific times of the day</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Philips Hue Led lamps do exactly this, but they go overboard on what I&#39;m planning to design.The Philips lights offer features such as voice control and dimmable lights in the light bulb.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Another idea I have considered including in my smart home is a device that will remind homeowners to hydrate regularly.With this device my intent was to focus on health for the homeowner.According to the lay press, 75% of adults are dehydrated and an adult should drink between 2.7 - 3.7 litres of water a day on average.This inspired me to incorporate an embedded system which would help track water consumption.I planned to do this by having the homeowner leave their drink on a pressure sensor that will monitor the weight of the drink and make conclusions based on the changes of the weight. After some research I figured that it&#39;s impractical to track water intake as we drink all around the house and from different containers so this embedded system would be inconvenient to make.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15">Lastly, another idea I have for the embedded system is a door alarm which will provide the homeowner with security. There are two main ways to make a door alarm using the microbit. Using light level and a magnet. I did consider using a pressure sensor for my door alarm but I figured it is overall the least practical and least convenient method.The light level way would work by having the microbit on one side of the doorway and </span><span class="c15">have</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;a laser point on the microbit from the other side , that way if any one goes through the doorway the light path is interrupted for a brief second or two and the microbit will register this. When browsing door alarms on the internet I noticed many of them use a magnet so this added extra incentive for me to use a magnet as I can make my embedded system more modern.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For the website , I looked at the requirements and I figured all of them can be achieved using html and css. I watched many tutorials on html and css and discovered everything that can be done with it. I plan to add a login system and a contact us page to my website to make it as modern as possible, and I think this can be done using either javascript, PHP and a database like MySQL and Firebase.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I will try research all of them and use the easiest way because I am not yet familiar with any of the languages and databases. I plan to watch tutorials on these languages to get a basic understanding, freeCodeCamp.org on youtube is where I plan to start, as I found them very easy to understand in the past and they helped me with my python knowledge</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Design:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The design of this embedded system and website will require me to constantly innovate and research new things as the days go on. I figured that I will need to be flexible with my learning to identify the best solutions so I can take the most practical route to complete my project and for that reason I will use the agile approach for this project. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Agile is the most appropriate way to approach this project in my opinion as it provides flexibility, the waterfall approach is much more linear and pre-planned meaning that I would have to have planned how I will do everything and when, which I think will not work because encountering problems and finding solutions by trying different methods is a big part of achieving the desired final product.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I created an embedded system that is used as part of a home automation system to provide the homeowner with security. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">My embedded system consists of two micro bits and a Kitronik discovery kit.These are readily available to me at my school and I already had some knowledge using the microbit which gave me a small headstart in creating the embedded system.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">My embedded system works like a door alarm. The microbit is secured on top of the doorway and a magnet is on the wall beside it. When the door is closed the microbit reads a high magnetic force, when it opens , this magnetic force drops to almost zero. When this happens, I sent a radio wave to my second microbit which acts like the alarm, telling it to turn on the LED and the buzzer on the breadboard.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c15">I coded the embedded system using the make code editor, I found it to be simple and intuitive. I used it over using python / javascript as it&#39;s easier to explain what is being done because it&#39;s represented visually using blocks. Makecode was a big part of the success of my embedded system as it allowed me to easily communicate my microbits with the computer and it allowed me to talk to the microbits using python. I was also able to communicate my micro bits using </span><span class="c15">radi</span><span class="c2">o wave technology.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">My embedded system meets the brief by adding the embedded system to a smart home which can then be controlled and monitored through a remote web application.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For demonstration purposes, my embedded system uses a buzzer along with a red LED. I built this setup using the Kitronik discovery kit. I was able to build the circuit easily and I found the discovery kit to be very practical as I can create any temporary circuit hassle free without soldering.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">My embedded system hopefully met the advanced requirements as I am able to monitor and control the embedded system from the website.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The implementation of controlling the microbit through the website was a lengthy process. I used a lot of solutions to get it working such as JavaScript , Python , makecode editor and Firebase. Firstly, I created an on and off button on my website, and I linked the buttons to a firebase database using javascript. The on and off buttons would control the &ldquo;on&rdquo; and &ldquo;off&rdquo; conditions in a directory in my firebase, I would then read these conditions from firebase using python and I would tell the microbit what to do using python based on the on/off conditions. Communicating between microbit and python is done using serial communication using USB ports on your pc.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I also believe my website meets both the basic and advanced requirements. My website features more than 4 pages and it is accessible. I have also used most of the basic html elements such as tables , lists etc. The website also features a &nbsp;&ldquo;Contact us&rdquo; form which collects user input and stores it in a third party database such as formspree. Validation checks are present in my login page and the contact form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The website was created using Html,css, javascript and php.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Html is the basic skeleton of the website, css makes everything look appealing, javascript is used to communicate with firebase, and php is used for the login system.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The website is also able to read from and write to the Firebase.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c19">Implementation and testing </span><span class="c4">:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 571.00px; height: 732.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 571.00px; height: 732.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The implementation of the artefact started heavily with the website, the first few weeks were strictly focused on learning css and html, after a week of research, I knew these would be 100% used in my project as part of making the website. Before I wasn&rsquo;t sure how I would make the website , because I thought HTML and CSS would be too difficult to learn in the time I had, but after watching a few tutorials and using codecademy, I came to the conclusion that I would be using HTML and CSS for my website. One thing that helped a lot while making the website was repl.it , it is an online text editor, and you can keep html, css and javascript files all in one project. Using repl helped me save much time as I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about losing my files nor did I have to look for any software for my coding.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The first part of making the artefact was making a logo and name that would suit the home automation business. To make the logo for &ldquo;Super Smart Home&rdquo;,I went straight to photoshop to design the logo as I&#39;m comfortable with using the software. I downloaded a free to use image of a house, changed the colours a bit and added some text beside the house.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">After creating the necessities of the website such as the nav bar, background , css styling etc, I went straight to the contact us form. I figured it&rsquo;s very important to have this in my website ,Initially I thought I needed a database and something outside of HTML such as PHP for it to work properly. After researching for a while I came across formspree, all I needed to do was set my form&rsquo;s &ldquo;action&rdquo; attribute to the formspree endpoint, and all the form data would be sent to formspree where I could view it instantly.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Trying to make a working login system as part of my website took a lot of time and took many unsuccessful attempts. Initially I was going to use a combination of PHP &amp; MySQL.With no knowledge on these, I realised after 2 weeks of trying, I got nowhere and I found the mySQL database too complicated. I then tried to use firebase for the sign up &amp; log in system. Firebase was easier to figure out straight away, as I was a tiny bit more familiar with javascript I could read the java script code from firebase&rsquo;s documentation. After a few days of working on it, I finally got the sign up system working, and the user would be authenticated into the data base.The problem was I could not figure out how to log in with that data. I tried for another few days but nothing worked so I gave up with firebase too. Finally I changed my plan with the login. I decided I will hardcode a single username and password with no sign up system,I done this with PHP. I watched some tutorials about php and quickly grasped the idea of it. One inconvenience using php caused was that I had to switch from replit, this took some time as I had to find a new text editor which supports php. I started using atom to code with php, and I finally got the login working.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The embedded system was not hard to make, the instructions from the Kitronik discovery kit helped me massively. I did not make the embedded system until the last 2 weeks, I had many ideas but was indecisive on which would be the best. I was going to do something with temperature and lights. Initially I was using light level for my door alarm, but came across a big problem. Whenever I was testing the door alarm, by taking light level away from the microbit I found the radio communication to be very slow. The code was basically &ldquo;If light level &lt; 200&rdquo; send radio string to second microbit and tell it to turn on LED (alarm) .The second microbit that controlled the alarm would consistently take 5 or 10 seconds to register any change at all in the light level, because of this I couldn&rsquo;t track if someone crossed the doorway, because sometimes it wouldnt even register change in light level at all. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Using the magnet for the door alarm was the better option for 2 main reasons. </span></p><ol class="c16 lst-kix_a512zehnv2h7-0 start" start="1"><li class="c0 c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">There wasn&rsquo;t any delay at all in radio communication.</span></li><li class="c0 c10 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2">I did not need to have a laser shining on the microbit constantly </span></li></ol><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Another issue I had was syncing the &ldquo;doorStatus&rdquo; variable while reading it in python using serial.Whenever I opened the door and triggered the alarm, the door would be registered as opened dozens of times in 5 or 6 seconds, and this would spam the firebase and website with data. To go about fixing that, I added a pause of 5 seconds to my microbit code after the status of the door was changed. So it would only log that the door was opened once in 5 seconds.Then I tried again, and I read the data in python, but this time it was out of sync in python. To fix this problem I used pythons time module, and I added the same 5 second pause between data readings just like in the microbit code.</span><br><br><video style="margin-left:70px; margin-top:20px;" width="450" height="auto" controls> <source src="Video/video.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4"</p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 451.00px; height: 629.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 451.00px; height: 629.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Evaluation</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I think the final product turned out quite well, for demonstration purposes I didn&rsquo;t show my microbit and alarm in proper use on a doorway, but in my spare time I set up the magnet along with the microbit on a door. It seemed to work quite well for the most part, except it became quite delayed when I had the alarm on the other side of the room.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I think most of the envisaged end users needs are met, except for some of the inconveniences that arise in monitoring the status of it. Whenever the door is left open, this is logged to the website and it will be logged as long as the door open.So basically, the homeowner must remember to close the door or else this alarm would have no point.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If I was to make this door alarm again, I would love to have it timed automatically, so that the alarm only works from 11pm to 8am for example. I think I was quite limited with hardware to create this. I did not fully research the microbits capabilities in terms of clocks and time, but I believe there are some extensions/add ons for the microbit that have the ability to do this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;d also try fix the issue of repeatedly logging the door opened status when it&#39;s left open. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For the website, I believe it accurately represents the likes of a fictional home automation company entering the industry. I should have included more user interface controls such as drop down lists or sliders.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In conclusion I think I met my design ambitions quite well, and I think my artefact suits the majority of the requirements.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span
